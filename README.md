# Working-Through-Programming-Digital-Music-with-SuperCollider-
SuperCollider patches written while working through the book "Programming Digital Music with SuperCollider."
Patch file names are usually created using the following method, using p4_first.scd as an example:
>the page number is the first part of the file name. If the concept presented or often the code, starts on page 4,
I make that the first part of the file name. p4 means page 4. Thay way I can go to that page to find it to read it again if I want to.
>the next part of the file name, ignoring the underscore, is the name presented by the author in this case. Other times, it is the topic
presented by the book. I might decide to create more than one patch between different concepts as I work through the book.
>Other file names might be text files used for different purposes. I am not sure what else gets used in SuperCollider so
that might change what gets posted here or described in this README.
